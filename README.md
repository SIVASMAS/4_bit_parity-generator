# 4_bit_parity-generator
 The 4-bit parity generator is a digital circuit designed to compute the parity bit for a 4-bit input data. It generates either an even or odd parity bit, depending on the configuration. This parity bit is used for error detection in data transmission or storage, ensuring data integrity
